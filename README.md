# homework2

<p> In this homework we took advantage of the HTML semantics, CSS styling and CSS framework - Bootstrap to create a portfolio for ourselves. </p>


# index.html

<p> In index.html we created a basic "About Me" template that can be viewed by employers and inform them a little something about me selves.
We started by creating a nav-bar that stays constant for all other html files. 
We made use of the jumbotron within which we nested a container. 
Both jumbotron and container are used with "fluid" mechanism which ensures that the webpage acts according to varying screen sizes. 
Within those columns found inside rows and containers I added "cards" yet another feature found on Bootstrap that let's me insert my profile pic on left side of the page and my bio on the right side of the page. 
I added some style components within the html itself that helps me customize the card, background image, opacity and fonts as well. 
At the very end I added a copyright logo to prevent anyone from using my portfolio without my permission. </p>

# contact.html

<p> In contact.html I created a page using "forms" and "contact forms" to create a basic template of the page. 
The first field takes first and last name as input. 
The second field takes a phone number as input. 
The third field takes email as input. 
The fourth field takes a message as an input.
All of this is contained within a card, which is contained within a container and all of that is contained within jumbotron.
The navbar stays consistent with index.html
Added some style elements similar to index.html </p>

# portfolio.html

<p> In portfolio.html I created a page using "media-objects" that allows me to enter a small picture along with multiple lines of text. 
MY first field contains information about the first HW that I did. 
MY second field contains information about the current HW I am working on. 
The navbar stays consistent with index and contact.html</p>

# linking htmls

<p> I linked each html to it's corresponding links to ensure when the user clicks on the link it should re-direct you to appropriate page. 
I linked my nav-bar to the "index" or homepage as well so if the user clicks on my name they will default to my home page. </p>

# staying consistent

<p> The key takeaway from this homework was to make everything look more uniform and concise. 
The importance of linking the right html pages to their corresponding links. 
Using bootstrap across all htmls to ensure the fluidic motion of webpages across screens of all sizes</p>
